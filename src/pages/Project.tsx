          The research unit on the project "Culture as a Good and as a Medium: New Categories of
          Heritage and Forms of Its Protection and Enhancement" aims to reflect on the evolution of
          the concept of cultural heritage, taking as a reference the analyses developed in the
          humanistic and social disciplines, together with the formal elaboration that has been
          developed in the legal field. The concept of heritage, in fact, has undergone a changing
          understanding over time, which has led to an enrichment of the categories that compose it.
          A similar evolution does not yet seem fully completed in the context of cultural institutions,
          much less if we look at the documents that, both nationally and internationally, have been
          produced for the purpose of regulating the protection and enhancement of cultural
          heritage.

        <p className="mb-4 text-primary-900">
          At the basis of these shifts in meaning, there seems to be, in addition to the changing
          historical understanding of culture, somehow inherent to the concept, the intersection of
          other concepts, such as that of cultural property linked to the materiality of the objects
          considered, and therefore to their juridical-economic value and not only to the value in the
          cultural sense that a community is willing to recognize. From here, it is then possible to
          observe a development in the sense of a normative and social definition of heritage no
          longer linked only to the materiality of the assets that compose it, and therefore of the need
          for the recognition, protection, and enhancement of an intangible or immaterial cultural
          heritage.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-primary-900">
          The research unit intends to deepen the study of this evolution, of its meaning in theoretical
          and applicative terms, with reference to its legal discipline, scientific research, and the new
          role that the institutions involved are called upon to play. A different understanding of
          cultural heritage has, in fact, led to important changes with respect to the methods of
          conservation and enhancement. To this, we must add the possibilities that open up thanks
          to digital technologies that have changed so much in the use of material heritage. At the
          same time, however, new technologies act as creators of new heritage, almost a category in
          itself between material and intangible heritage, which some have already wanted to define
          as digital heritage.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-primary-900">
          In this way, a sort of dematerialized culture in practices and contents is emerging, where the
          legal principles in force can, on the one hand, facilitate, and on the other hand, hinder
          digitization and access to these practices and contents. The legal scholar here is called to
          provide his contribution, certainly on the side of private law with regard to licenses,
          intellectual property rights, Digital Rights Management, or fair use, for example. Also, on
          the public law side, the contribution of legal scholars is necessary and urgent at the
          legislative and jurisprudential level with respect to the rights and interests at stake (the
          author, the holder, the user), and to the participatory governance measures.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-primary-900">
          But, we think, it is above all at the level of the development of cultural policies that the
          interaction between legal science and the other humanistic-social disciplines becomes
          indispensable in the determination, we could say, of a common culture to which to refer not
          only in the definition of concepts that are historically conditioned, but also in the
          construction of practices of sharing and participation, where the "culture" must also include
          the medium of expression. And this also applies to our ability to communicate science, our
          work in research. Scientific communication is not "communication of science," as it remains
          a communication within the scientific system. The communication of science outside the
          scientific system, on the other hand, cannot refer only to the "hard" sciences, but must also
          extend to the Humanities and therefore to our disciplines, to our sectors. Nor is it just a
          matter of "popularization" of science but of a culture of communication, of conversation as a
          process of building knowledge which in turn becomes a value, a shared heritage.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-primary-900">
          Eventually, wanting to go beyond our research and "third mission" work, it seems to me that
          the last point can offer a suggestive course of action, if we also consider teaching as a type
          of communication, a conversation that produces knowledge. Although referring to the
          material culture of the arts, UNESCO's "system of human living treasure" seemed to also talk
          about this aspect of our work and recognize aspects that were previously not taken into
          consideration. It was, in fact, noted that, while in the Western world the recognition of an
          intangible heritage has hardly gained ground, this immateriality instead constitutes the
          central nucleus of the notion of identity in some Eastern societies. In Japan, we read, "the
          legislation that protects cultural heritage also includes individuals. Since 1955, this
          legislation makes a distinction between intangible cultural assets (theater, music, dance),
          the artistic professions or handicraft activities, and individuals endowed with this knowledge
          and who have the task of transmitting it" (Vecco, 2010). A legislation UNESCO wanted to
          implement with the above-mentioned program.
